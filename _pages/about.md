I am now a master student in [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). Before that, I spent some time as a research intern at [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/), advised by Prof. [Richard Xu](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/yida.xu) and [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Quanshi Zhang](http://qszhang.com/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering Degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/). 
Here is my [CV](http://chenyilan.net/files/resume_web.pdf). 
**I am looking for a phd position starting from 2022.**
